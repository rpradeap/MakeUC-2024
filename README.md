# Daily Estimation of Phosphorus in the Ohio River Basin Using a Remote Sensing Driven Machine Learning Model

Phosphorus is a vital nutrient found in river systems, essential for aquatic life. However, excessive phosphorus levels can have detrimental effects on human health, wildlife, ecosystems, and the economy. High concentrations of phosphorus often lead to harmful algal blooms, eutrophication, and oxygen depletion, severely disrupting aquatic environments.

Traditional methods for monitoring phosphorus levels are often costly, labor-intensive, and impractical for assessing the vast and complex networks of rivers. Given the challenges of conventional approaches, a more efficient and scalable solution is needed.

## Approach

In this study, we applied a machine learning model that integrates remote sensing data with watershed characteristics to estimate riverine phosphorus levels on a daily scale.
We use Landsat satellite data to estimate the phosphorus level in the Ohio River. 
Our model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting phosphorus concentrations across the Ohio River Basin, offering a reliable tool for real-time monitoring.

## Impact

This approach not only aids in the ongoing monitoring of river ecosystems but also provides valuable insights for policymakers to better understand the temporal and spatial variations in riverine Total Phosphorus (TP) levels. Ultimately, this method can contribute to more effective environmental management, safeguarding aquatic life, improving ecosystem health, and mitigating the economic impacts of nutrient pollution.

By offering a cost-effective and scalable solution, our model has the potential to support sustainable practices that protect both the environment and the communities dependent on these water systems.
